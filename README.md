## FAQ/Common Mistakes

### Delay values

By default, the value is 100 which is 100 ms between actions, if your connection or computer is slow you may need to increase the value to up to 250 or more!

### "Refresh Values" Button

The refresh values button reconfigures the script for use with another payout than 2.00x, *if you change the payout to anything other than 2.00x press the button!*
This button can also be used if the script isn't working correctly (like doubling the bet when you win).
